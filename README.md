# Forkify

Forkify is a website that allows you to search for recipes, so that you can find new ideas for meals. You can:

- update the number of servings, so that you can cook a
  meal for different number of people;
- bookmark recipes, so that you can review them later;
- create your own recipes, so that you have them all organized in the same app;
- see your bookmarks and own recipes when you leave the app and come back later, so that you can close the app safely after cooking.
